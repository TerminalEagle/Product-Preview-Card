## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Although I had taken a course on HTML and CSS, I didn't have a lot of practical experience, so the exercises really helped me put the concepts I had learned to use in a more real-world setting. In particular, using flex-boxes and CSS properties like "max-width," "min-width," and "background-image."
